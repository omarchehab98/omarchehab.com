Hello, I'm Omar Chehab, a student by day and a software developer by night. I'm a fourth year undergraduate student studying Computer Science at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca).

I enjoy debating at Model United Nations and being sleep deprived at Hackathons.

Email me at <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">{{site.email}}</a>.

My PGP key has the fingerprint `83B8 E36E 8C17 8CDC E402 DB58 6821 DA05 B0D2 86AD` and the public key is available on the [Open PGP Key Server](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q={{site.email}}).
