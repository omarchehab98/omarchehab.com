Hello, I'm Omar Chehab, a student by day and a software engineer by night. I'm a third year undergraduate Computer Science student at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca) specializing in Software Engineering.

I founded ManageMUN with the vision to improve MUNs. I currently work part-time at Al Jaras.

I enjoy debating at Model United Nations and being sleep deprived at Hackathons.

Message me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/omar-chehab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>.

Email me at <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">{{site.email}}</a>.

My GPG key has the fingerprint <code>83B8 E36E 8C17 8CDC E402 DB58 6821 DA05 B0D2 86AD</code> and is available at [MIT's PGP Public Key Server](http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x6821DA05B0D286AD).
