Hello, I'm Omar Chehab, a student by day and a software engineer by night. I'm a third year undergraduate Computer Science student at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca) specialising in Software Engineering.

I enjoy debating at Model United Nations and being sleep deprived at Hackathons.

Email me at <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">{{site.email}}</a>.

My GPG key has the fingerprint `83B8 E36E 8C17 8CDC E402 DB58 6821 DA05 B0D2 86AD` and is available on the [SKS Keyserver Pool](https://pool.sks-keyservers.net/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x6821DA05B0D286AD).
